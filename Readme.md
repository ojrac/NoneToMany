What Does it Mean
-----------------
This is an April Fools joke inflicted on the HubSpot team in 2011.
It was built by
[dmilstein](https://github.com/dmilstein),
[ehebert](https://github.com/ehebert),
[katzj](https://github.com/katzj),
[ojrac](https://github.com/ojrac) and
[tomheon](https://github.com/tomheon), and based on an extremely old therapist.py
[dmilstein](https://github.com/dmilstein) found.

Any resemblence to humanity is accidental, but pretty sweet if you ask me.

Installation
------------

- `ln -s /path/to/app /var/www/django/eliza`
- whatever you need to do to httpd
